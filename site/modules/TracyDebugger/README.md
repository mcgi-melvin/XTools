# Tracy Debugger
Tracy Debugger is a module for the ProcessWire CMF/CMS for integrating Nette's awesome Tracy debugging tool.

In addition to Tracy's core functionality, this module comes with more than 30 custom tools designed to help you get the ProcessWire information you need for effective debugging.

These tools extend Tracy beyond just debugging and tranform it into a development swiss army knife!

### About Tracy

* manually log errors in development mode
* automatically log and email errors in production mode
* dump variables with a fully expandable tree for arrays and objects
* measure execution time of scripts/queries
* see memory consumption and CPU usage

### Acknowledgements
Firstly, I want to send out a big thanks to [@tpr](https://processwire.com/talk/profile/3156-tpr/) / [@rolandtoth](https://github.com/rolandtoth/) for introducing me to Tracy and for the idea for this module and for significant feedback, testing, and feature suggestions. Many other forum members have also been instrumental in testing. I started listing them out, but it became too long and I didn't want to miss anyone, so a big general thanks to everyone – it has been a real community effort to get everything working on all systems. I’d especially like to thank all those users who provided tips in the support thread for setting up the editor protocol handler for their favorite code editor.

In keeping with the already considerable community involvement in this module, please let me know if you have ideas for other features that you'd like to see, or changes to existing ones.
